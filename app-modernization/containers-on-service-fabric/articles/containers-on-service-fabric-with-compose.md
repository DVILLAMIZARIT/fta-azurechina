## Introduction
The goal of this POC is to walk you through the process of migrating an existing 3 tier application running on-premises to a multi-container application running in a Service Fabric Cluster. You will start with a classic ASP.NET MVC Application, converting its components (frontend and services layers) to containers, deploying them to a registry, and then running the application within Service Fabric.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
* Create an Azure Container Registry
* Create an Azure Service Fabric cluster
* Create an Azure SQL Database
* Wrap an existing application into multiple Containers
* Push the Containers to the Registry
* Deploy to Service Fabric using DockerCompose

## Prerequisites
To complete this POC, you will need
* Access to a Microsoft Azure subscription and permissions to deploy resources
* Visual Studio 2017
* [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
* [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
* You will need the [Service Fabric SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=MicrosoftAzure-ServiceFabric-CoreSDK) installed
* You must download the [Contoso Expenses Demo Application](https://fasttrackforazure.blob.core.windows.net/sourcecode/Contoso.Expenses.zip)

## Open Existing Application with Visual Studio
1. **Extract the Contoso Expenses Demo Application** previously downloaded to a working folder of your choice
2. From the working folder, open Contoso.Expenses.sln

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose001.png)
3. Validate that there are 4 projects in Visual Studio:
* **Contoso.Expenses.API** - This is a Web API project that provides helper logic to the main web app.
* **Contoso.Expenses.DataAccess** - This is a Class Library that utilizes Entity Framework.
* **Contoso.Expenses.Database** - This is a Database project that contains the SQL to create the Expenses table and SQL to initially seed default data.
* **Contoso.Expenses.Web** - This is the Internal Business Web App.

## Create the SQL Database
1. Log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
2. Click on **+New**, type **Resource Group** in the search area, press **Enter**.
3. Click on **Resource Group** and the click on **Create**.
4.  Enter a descriptive name (e.g. **ContosoExpenses-RG-WE**) as the **Resource group name**.
5. Select your **Subscription**.
6. Select your **Resource Group Location** (e.g. West Europe).
7. Click **Create**.

13. For **Server**, click **Configure required settings**.
14. Click **Create a new Server**.
15. For **Server Name**, your SQL Server Name (e.g. **contosoexpensesdbsrv**).
> **Note:** The server name needs to be globally unique, so add a number to the end of name.
16. Enter a **Server admin login** and **Password**.
> **Note:** Save the **Login name** and **Password**, as youâ€™ll need it later.
17. For Location select the same location as before (e.g. **West Europe**).
18. Click **Select** to save the server settings.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose005.png)

19. Click on **Pricing Tier**.
20. Move the **DTU** slider to **20**.
> **Note:** DTU's are Database Transaction Units and measure database performance with a blended measure of CPU, memory, I/O.  For more information on DTU's, see [Explaining Database Transaction Units](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-what-is-a-dtu).

21. Move the **Storage** slider to **5GB**.
22. Click **Apply**.

23. Click **Create** to create a new SQL Database Server & Database.

> **Note:** The Azure alert bell will indicate that the deployment is in progress.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose007.png)

## Allow Client IP in SQL Database Firewall
To add the **IP address** of the client you access the database from, do the following steps:
1. Select the database created previously (e.g. contosoexpensesdb), click on **Set server firewall**.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose008.png)

2. Click on **Add client IP** and click **Save**. This will add your current IP as a new rule on the Firewall.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose009.png)

## Publish the Database into Azure SQL DB
1. From Visual Studio, expand the project **Contoso.Expenses.Database**.
2. Click on the **Seed.sql** file under the **Scripts folder**, and look at content in the preview window.
> **Note:** This file will get executed post-deployment and add test data to the database.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose010.png)

3. **Right-click** on the project **Contoso.Expenses.Database** and select **Publish** to publish the database.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose011.png)
  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose012.png)
  
4. On **Target database connection** click **Edit**, then click **Browse**.

5. From the list presented, expand **Azure**.
6. Select the **Database** created on the SQL Server in the previous steps.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose013.png)

7. For the **Server Name**, confirm or enter the server name previously saved to the clipboard (e.g. **contosoexpensesdbsrv.database.windows.net**).
8. Set **Authentication** to **SQL Server Authentication**.
9. Enter the database server **User Name** and **Password**. Select the checkbox **Remember Password**.
10. Select the database name **contosoexpensesdb**.
11. Click **Test Connection**.
> **Note:** You may get prompted to add a firewall rule so that your computer is allowed to access the database server. If so, click **Ok** to allow the firewall rule to be created.
![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose014.png)
12. The result should be **Test connection succeeded**, then click **Ok**.
 Click **Ok** to close the connect window.

13. Click on **Publish** to publish the database to Azure.
 ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose015.png)

  * The database will be published to Azure and give you the results.
* The status and progress will be displayed in the Data Tools Operations window.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose016.png)

## View the database using Visual Studio Tools
1. From **Visual Studio**, select **View** | **SQL Server Object Explorer**.
2. Expand the **SQL Server** node to view the connection.
3. Expand the connection **contosoexpensesdbsrv.database.windows.net**, and then **Databases | contosoexpensesdb | Tables**. Confirm the existence of the **dbo.Expense** table.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose017.png)

## Create Storage Account
You will create a new Azure Storage Account because the Application uses Azure Storage Queues to persist transactions when the database is not available.

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), click in **New** and search for Storage Account. 

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose030.png)

2. Select that option shown in the image and on the following blade click **Create**.

3. Give a name to your storage account and ensure the storage account is deployed in the same resource group.

  ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose031.png)

> **Note:** The storage account name needs to be unique, and only supports lowercase letters and numbers.

4. After the creation of the storage account, navigate to it, click on **Access Keys** and copy the first connection string. We will need it further on.

 ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose032.png)

## Configure Container Registry
We will need a place to store the containers that we are creating for this application. For this example we will be creating an Azure Container Registry.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Create a new resource and search the marketplace for **Azure Container** and select **Azure Container Registry**.

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose018.png)

3. Give the registry a name and assign it to a resource group. Click **Create**.
> **Note:** This name must be unique in the Azure platform.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose019.png)

## Create Service Fabric Cluster
In order to run the application now, we will need to create a cluster to deploy to.

1. In the Azure portal, click **New**, search for **Service Fabric**, and then select **Service Fabric Cluster**. Click **Create**.

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose020.png)
2. On the *Basics* blade, fill in the appropriate information for the cluster and assign it to the resource group we have already created. Click **Ok**.
    > **Note:** Make sure for *Operating system*, you choose **WindowsServer 2016-Datacenter- with-Containers**

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose021.png)
3. On the *Cluster configuration* blade, leave **Node type count** as 1, then click to configure the node type. Provide the following details:
    * **Node type name** - BaseNode
    * **Durability tier** - Bronze
    * **Virtual machine size** - Standard_D1_v2
    * **Custom endpoints** - 80,443
    * **Enable reverse proxy** - Select check box
    
    Click **Ok** then **Ok** again.

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose022.png)

4. On the *Security* blade, select **Unsecure** and then click **Ok**.
5. On the *Summary* blade, click **Create**.
    > **Note:** This will take several minutes and even once the creation of the cluster is complete, it will still need a few more minutes to perform some internal updates.

## Migrate Application to Containers
Now that all the infrastructure and dependencies are deployed it's time to start modernizing the application.

1. Open the application downloaded previously (**Contoso.Expenses**) in Visual Studio.
2. Expand project Contoso.Expenses.Web, open Web.Config file and edit the  connection strings **DefaultConnection** and **ContosoExpensesDataEntities** to new SQL Database. Replace **{your_username}** and **{your_password}** by the values specified during the database creation.

````XML
<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Server=tcp:contosoexpensesdbsrv.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=contosoexpensesdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
<add name="ContosoExpensesDataEntities" connectionString="metadata=res://*/Models.ContosoExpensesModel.csdl|res://*/Models.ContosoExpensesModel.ssdl|res://*/Models.ContosoExpensesModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=tcp:contosoexpensesdbsrv.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=contosoexpensesdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;App=EntityFramework&quot;" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
    
````
> **Note:** The connection string for your SQL Database is in the Azure Portal.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose023.png)

3. In the same Web.Config file update the value for EmployeeApiUri.
````XML
<add key="EmployeeApiUri" value="http://contoso.expenses.api:8123" />
````
> **Note:** This value should reflect the api **container name** and **node port**. The **node port** will be configured in the compose file.

4. Update the Storage Account Connection String to the value you copied during the Storage Account creation step.

````XML
<add key="StorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[ACCOUNT-NAME];AccountKey=[ACCOUNT-KEY];EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net" />
````
> **Note:** This will add support to Azure Storage Queues to the Contoso.Expenses application.

5. Right-click **Contoso.Expenses.Web** project, select **Add** and then **Docker Support**.

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose024.png)

> **Note:** Visual Studio will automatically create a new project (**[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)**) and a **[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)** in **Contoso.Expenses.Web** project.

6. Notice the **docker-compose** project and the Dockerfile that were create by Visual Studio.

    ![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose025.png)


7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for **Contoso.Expenses.API** project.
8. Check **docker-compose.yml** file in **docker-compose** project. 

````yml
version: '3'

services:
  contoso.expenses.web:
    image: contoso.expenses.web
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.Web
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

  contoso.expenses.api:
    image: contoso.expenses.api
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.API
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
````
> **Note:** This file is the declaration of the services that compose our application and how each of them are built. 

9. Right-click your Solution and select **Build Solution**.
> **Note:** In order to build the solution successfuly you need to make sure you have installed **Docker for Windows** and configured it to run in **Windows Containers**.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose026.png)

> **Note:** If you are running Docker for Windows and you used the Docker Tools in Visual Studio your may get the following error.

```` DOCKER
**Step 5/6 : COPY ${source:-obj/Docker/publish} .
COPY failed: GetFileAttributesEx \\?\C:\Windows\TEMP\docker-builder460102490\obj\Docker\publish: The system cannot find the file specified.**
````

> **Solution:** Update the existing DockerFile (in both Web and API projects) with the following and try to rebuild the solution.
````DOCKERFILE
FROM microsoft/aspnet:4.7
WORKDIR /inetpub/wwwroot
COPY /obj/Docker/publish .
````

10. Build the container images. **Open a command prompt** in the contoso.expenses.web folder and run the following command

````docker
C:\..\Contoso.Expenses.Web>docker build -t [YOUR-REGISTRY]/contoso.expenses.web:1.0 .
````
> **Note:** Replace [YOUR-REGISTRY] with your own registry name (e.g. sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io). This is recommended pattern for images that are pulled from or pushed to external registries. 

11. Repeat step 10 for project **contoso.expenses.api**.

12. List all images available in your local repository. Run the following command and you should see the 2 images built during the last step(contoso.expenses.web and contoso.expenses.api).
````docker
docker images
````
> **Note:** During the building process of new images some base images may be downloaded (e.g. **microsoft/aspnet:4.7**)

````BASH
C:\..\Contoso.Expenses.Web>docker images
REPOSITORY                                       TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web   1.0                 9a8606d9e43f        4 minutes ago       12.6GB
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api   1.0                 8030f7171b4f        12 minutes ago      12.6GB

````

## Push Containers to Registry
Now that the images have been created it's time to push them to the Registry. 

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your **Azure Container Registry**. Copy **Login server**, **Username** and **Password** values.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose027.png)

2. Open a command prompt and login to Azure Container Registry.

````BASH
C:\..\Contoso.Expenses.Web>docker login sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io
Username: sfcomposedevcr
Password:
Login Succeeded
````

3. Push Contoso.Expenses.Web image to Azure Container Registry. 

````BASH
C:\..\Contoso.Expenses.Web>docker push sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web:1.0
The push refers to a repository [sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web]
4c48207d1889: Pushing [=================>                                 ]  14.06MB/41.06MB

79390eafd4aa: Waiting
6000697d961e: Waiting
ec2e04360e6c: Waiting
f358be10862c: Waiting
````

4. Repeat step 3 for Contoso.Expenses.Api image.

5. Validate in Azure Container Registry that the images have been pushed.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose028.png)

## Deploy to Service Fabric
At this point the images are already hosted in Azure Container Registry so the next step is to deploy the containers to Service Fabric.

1. Open Visual Studio, expand the **docker-compose** project and open the **docker-compose.yml** file.

2. **Update the image names** and ports. This is the file we will use to deploy the application to Azure Service Fabric.

> **Note:** Make sure that your container registry is correct (e.g. sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io)

````YML
version: '3'

services:
  contoso.expenses.web:
    image: sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web:1.0
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.Web
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  contoso.expenses.api:
    image: sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api:1.0
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.API
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8123:80"
````
> **Note:** [Port definition](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#ports) is composed of **[NODE PORT]:[CONTAINER PORT]**. 
3. Open PowerShell and navigate to the **docker-compose project root folder**.

4. Connect to your Azure Service Fabric Cluster

````POWERSHELL
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint composeapps-sf.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:19000
````
> **Note:** The Service Fabric Connection Endpoint is shown in the Azure Portal. Navigate to your Service Fabric instance and find it in the overview tab.

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose029.png)

5. Deploy application to Service Fabric using docker compose.
````POWERSHELL
# CREATE NEW SERVICE
New-ServiceFabricComposeDeployment -DeploymentName Contoso -Compose docker-compose.yml -RegistryUserName [REGISTRY-USERNAME] -RegistryPassword [REGISTRY-PASSWORD]
````
> **Registry username** and **password** can be found in Azure Container Registry settings in Azure Portal.

6. Open **Azure Service Fabric Explorer** from the Azure Portal and check if your application is deploying. 

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose033.png)

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose034.png)
> **Note:** Please allow some minutes for the nodes to be ready since this is the first deployment to these nodes and the image is pretty large. Every node has its own image repository so deployment times may change depending on whether layers already exist in the node or not.

> If you see the application status changing to error please validate the node status. It may simply be because your download is taking to long. If that is the case there is no action needed on your side other than waiting. 

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose035.png)

> **Note:** A **best practice** for this scenario where images are very large would be to pull the images in every node prior to deployment. 

7. Access the application externally once the deployment ends. During the walkthrough we configured the external load balancer to expose port 80 and we did the same when deploying the images for Contoso.Expenses.Web. Go to your Public IP Address Configuration in Azure and navigate to specified DNS name label (e.g. http://composeapps-sf.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com)

![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose036.png)

## Upgrade existing Application
Service Fabric allows easy upgrades with failover in case something wrong happens.

1. **Build new version** of the application. This way we will leverage the docker-compose file to support the build process. **Update the docker-compose.yml** file and **build your solution in Visual Studio**.

````YML
version: '3'

services:
  contoso.expenses.web:
    image: sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web:1.1
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.Web
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  contoso.expenses.api:
    image: sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api:1.1
    build:
      context: .\Contoso.Expenses.API
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8123:80"
````
2. Validate new images in local repository. You should see version 1.1 of your images.
```` BASH
C:\..\Contoso.Expenses.Web>docker images
REPOSITORY                                       TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web   1.0                 44e0f6ad7624        About an hour ago   12.6GB
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web   1.1                 44e0f6ad7624        About an hour ago   12.6GB
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api   1.0                 449ee2643df0        About an hour ago   12.6GB
sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api   1.1                 449ee2643df0        About an hour ago   12.6GB
microsoft/aspnet                                 4.7                 eea632769046        6 days ago          12.6GB
````

3. Push new images to registry.

````BASH
docker push sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.web:1.1
docker push sfcomposedevcr.azurecr.io/contoso.expenses.api:1.1
````
> This time the push should be much faster because most layers are already in the registry.

4. With PowerShell window still open and after connecting to the Service Fabric Cluster, run the following Cmdlet.

````POWERSHELL
# UPGRADE SERVICE
Start-ServiceFabricComposeDeploymentUpgrade -DeploymentName contoso -Compose docker-compose.yml -Monitored -FailureAction Rollback -RegistryUserName [REGISTRY-USERNAME] -RegistryPassword [REGISTRY-PASSWORD]
````
> **Note:** The [Start-ServiceFabricComposeDeploymentUpgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/servicefabric/start-servicefabriccomposedeploymentupgrade?view=azureservicefabricps) Cmdlet contains multiple parameter variations that allow for different deployment types and failover mechanisms.

5. Validate that the upgrade is in progress
![Screenshot](media/containers-on-service-fabric-with-compose/sf-compose037.png)

> **Note:** The upgrade time may depend on the downloading time for the images. Still since we configured the deployment to be monitored it should only destroy previous instances when the new version is up and running.

## Scale Application Services
Service Fabric allows you to scale services independently. This way you can scale based on current load in each service.

1. Navigate to Service Fabric Explorer (e.g. http://composeapps-sf.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:19080), right-click the **contoso.expenses.api node** and select **Scale Service**.

2. Choose a value **between 1 and the total number of nodes** you have in the Service Fabric cluster. Then select Scale Service.

3. Validate that **contoso.expenses.api** is being scaled to more nodes.
