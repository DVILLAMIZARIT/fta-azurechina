# POC Scenario Voting Application: Working with Service Fabric Services  
# Abstract  
The goal of this poc is to make you familiar with an end to end development flow for Service Fabric applications. You will practice creating a new Service Fabric application on your development machine, working with stateless services, deploying, updating and monitoring an application deployment. Throughout the exercise, you will get accustomed with Visual Studioâ€™s Service Fabric tooling, Service Fabric Explorer and learn how to effectively use both.

**The voting application consists of two services**:
* Web front-end service (VotingWeb)- An ASP.NET Core web front-end service, which serves the web page and exposes web APIs to communicate with the backend service.
* Back-end service (VotingData)- An ASP.NET Core web service, which exposes an API to store the vote results in a reliable dictionary persisted on disk.
 
**When you vote in the application the following events occur**:
1. A JavaScript sends the vote request to the web API in the web front-end service as an HTTP PUT request.
2. The web front-end service uses a proxy to locate and forward an HTTP PUT request to the back-end service.
3. The back-end service takes the incoming request, and stores the updated result in a reliable dictionary, which gets replicated to multiple nodes within the cluster and persisted on disk. All the application's data is stored in the cluster, so no database is needed.

# Learning objectives
After completing the exercises in this module, you will be able to:
* Set up and manage Service Fabric clusters on your development machine
* Set up Service Fabric Clusters in Azure
* Understand the concepts of Service Fabric applications, services, stateless services, application lifecycle management, upgrades, diagnostics and health
* Use Visual Studio and Service Fabric Explorer to efficiently develop Service Fabric applications

## Pre-Requisites
* To complete this PoC, you will need:
