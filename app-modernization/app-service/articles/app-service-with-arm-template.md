# Deploy ContosoExpenses Dependencies using ARM template
The purpose of this template is to deploy the Contoso Expenses POC dependencies. The following resources will be deployed:
* 1 Function App
* 2 Storage Accounts
* 1 SQL Database
[comment]:<jacky: SendGrid Email Delivery is not available in china cloud, thus the arm deployment will fail>
* 1 SendGrid Email 

This template uses GitHub integration to deploy to the Azure WebApps and Azure Function. It will also restore the database using a _.bacpac_ file.

# Steps to deploy
1. [Run requirements script](#run-requirements-script)
2. [Deploy the template](#deploy-the-template)
3. [Configure SendGrid](#configure-sendgrid)


## Run requirements script
1. Clone the [Repository](https://github.com/t1agob/fta-internalbusinessapps).
2. Navigate to **/appmodernization/app-service/src/Contoso.Expenses.ARM/pre-reqs** folder.

    This folder contains a PowerShell script that you need to run in order to copy the database to a storage account in your subcription.

3. **Run the script and make sure to copy the output** somewhere since it will be used in the template deployment phase.

## Configure SendGrid
After deploying the template successfuly the SendGrid resource is already deployed in Azure but we need to generate an API Key and add it to the Azure Function Settings.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your SendGrid resource.
2. Go to _Configurations_ and **copy the username** that was automatically created.

2. Go to [http://app.sendgrid.com/](http://app.sendgrid.com/) and log in using the username copied just now and the password created during the template deployment step.
